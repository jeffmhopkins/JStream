The Windows implementations of the [`jstream-platform`](../jstream-platform/README.md#purpose)
traits. Layer 2, and one of the crates allowed `unsafe`
([R-UNSAFE-001](../../docs/RULES.md#R-UNSAFE-001)): every OS call is wrapped here, behind
the traits' safe APIs, with RAII types for COM objects, events and wave formats
([R-UNSAFE-003](../../docs/RULES.md#R-UNSAFE-003)). It uses Microsoft's `windows` crate
([R-UNSAFE-004](../../docs/RULES.md#R-UNSAFE-004)). The backends exist only on Windows;
elsewhere the crate builds just its platform-independent helpers, which are tested on
every platform.

The code is ported from spikes S1 to S3. This first cut has:
- **`QpcClock`** (`MediaClock`): QueryPerformanceCounter in **100 ns ticks**
  (`timebase()`), the unit WASAPI and Media Foundation use, and the unit the
  `jstream-platform` README proposes for every platform. A raw reading is converted with
  the formula WASAPI uses for `pu64QPCPosition`, so clock readings and packet times share
  one time line ([ADR-0014](../../docs/adr/0014-media-clock.md)). `now` never decreases.
- **`WasapiAudio`** (`AudioIo`):
  - **Listing** the active capture and render endpoints, with the console-role default
    of each.
  - **Streams** for every target the traits define: an input, the default input, loopback
    of an output or the default output, process loopback (a process and its children,
    through the virtual process-loopback device), an output and the default output.
    Each stream is event-driven and shared-mode, on its own thread registered with MMCSS
    "Pro Audio" ([ARCH › Threads, clock and sync](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#threading)).
    That thread owns the stream's COM objects. In its loop it calls the handler and does
    not allocate, lock or log ([R-RT-001](../../docs/RULES.md#R-RT-001)): the sample
    buffer is allocated once, before the stream starts.
  - **Format:** samples are interleaved `f32` at the device's own rate. A device whose
    mix format is already `f32` in a layout `jstream-media` has (mono, stereo, 5.1) is
    opened as is. For any other format the backend asks WASAPI to convert
    (`AUTOCONVERTPCM`) to `f32` at the same rate: it converts integer samples and
    downmixes other channel counts to stereo, and never resamples. For an output with
    another channel count the stream is stereo, and WASAPI maps it onto the device's
    speakers. `jstream-media`'s 5.1 has its surround pair at the back, so a 5.1 device
    whose mix puts it at the side is opened through the same conversion, and WASAPI
    maps its channels into that order. Process loopback is asked for 48 kHz stereo,
    since it has no mix format.
  - **Times and positions:** packet times are WASAPI's QPC positions, `None` when the
    device flags a timestamp error. Device positions count frames since the stream
    started.
  - **Default devices are followed:** a stream on a default device moves to the new
    default when the user changes it or the device goes away. Its positions continue, and
    the first packet after the move is flagged as a discontinuity. If the new device has
    a different format, the stream ends with `DeviceLost` so the engine can reopen it. A
    stream on one device ends with `DeviceLost` when that device goes away.
  - **Failures and panics:** a failure in a stream's loop is reported once through the
    handler's `on_error`, and the stream ends. A panic on the stream thread, the
    handler's included, is caught there. The stream ends, and `on_error` gets
    `InvalidState`. COM callbacks (activation completion, device notifications) catch
    panics too ([R-UNSAFE-005](../../docs/RULES.md#R-UNSAFE-005)).
  - **Buffers:** capture and loopback ask for a 200 ms buffer, as S3 did, so a late
    thread loses nothing. Render asks for 40 ms, which bounds how far ahead the output
    handler is asked for samples.

**Not yet:** Windows.Graphics.Capture, Media Foundation encoders and decoders, the GPU
interop path ([ARCH › GPU pipeline](../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#gpu-pipeline)), the
virtual-camera sink, and a `Backends` constructor, which needs all of them.

**Tests:** the clock conversion and the stream helpers (format choice, sample copies,
packet flags, positions across a device move) run on every platform, and the QPC clock
test runs on Windows. Tests against real devices are platform tests: behind the
`hw-tests` feature and `#[ignore]`d, because CI machines may have no audio devices
([R-TEST-004](../../docs/RULES.md#R-TEST-004)). Run them on a Windows machine with a
microphone and speakers:
`cargo test -p jstream-platform-windows --features hw-tests -- --ignored`.

## Open questions
<!-- @section
-->

- **Render times.** `AudioRenderBuffer::time` (when the first frame will play) is always
  `None` for now. `IAudioClock` can give it once the engine needs output sync, for
  example for monitoring with delay compensation.
- **Moving to a default device with another format.** For now the stream ends with
  `DeviceLost` and the engine reopens it. Instead the backend could ask WASAPI to convert
  to the old format, which would keep the stream running but would resample if the
  rates differ. Decided with `jstream-audio`.
