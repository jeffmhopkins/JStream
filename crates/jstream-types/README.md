## Purpose
<!-- @section
covers = ["crates/jstream-types/src/**"]
depends_on = ["docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#crate-map"]
verified = { hash = "b3:1f7b157de5107fb5", by = "agent:claude@session_01QBbMRwRuZe7FL4ak2fU793", note = "Upstream crate-map change only touched the jstream-sources and jstream-platform-windows rows (browser built-in, CEF backend); this crate's row and purpose text unaffected" }
-->

Layer-0 value types shared by every JStream crate. No dependencies on other JStream crates,
and no `unsafe`.

Contents so far:
- `Rational`: an exact, reduced rational number for frame rates and time bases
  (e.g. `30000/1001`).

Still to come in M0: IDs, math (Vec/Mat/Transform3D), color, units.
